# Deploying DevPilot (free tier, demo mode)

This guide deploys DevPilot as a **public portfolio demo** at no hosting cost:

| Piece | Host | Free-tier catch |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend (Next.js) | **Vercel** (Hobby) | None that matter here |
| Backend (Spring Boot) | **Render** (Free web service) | Sleeps after 15 min idle; first request takes ~1 min to wake |
| Database (Postgres + pgvector) | **Neon** (Free) | 0.5 GB storage; sleeps when idle (wakes in under a second) |
| LLM + embeddings | **OpenAI** | Not free: needs ~$5 prepaid credit, but a demo uses cents |

## How it fits together

```
Browser ──► https://<app>.vercel.app ─┬─► Next.js pages (Vercel)
                                      │

                                           proxied to ──► https://<api>.onrender.com (Spring Boot)
                                                                   │
                                                                   ├─► Neon Postgres (pgvector)
                                                                   ├─► OpenAI
                                                                   └─► GitHub API
```

**Why the proxy?** The backend keeps you logged in with a session cookie. Browsers won't send
cookies to a *different* site (`vercel.app` → `onrender.com`) on API calls, so login would
silently fail. With `BACKEND_URL` set, `client/next.config.ts` makes Vercel forward the backend's
paths, so the browser only ever talks to `vercel.app` and the cookie stays first-party. No
custom domain needed.

**What demo mode does** (`DEMO_MODE=true`):

- The login page shows **Try the live demo**: visitors get a guest session without GitHub.
- Visitors only see the preset repos in `DEMO_REPOS`, and can't sync or index.
- Only `DEMO_ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAMES` (you) can sign in with GitHub to sync and index, and only the preset repos.
- Each visitor gets `DEMO_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_USER` questions (default 20). All visitors combined get
  `DEMO_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_DAY` (default 300) per UTC day. This caps the OpenAI bill.
- GitHub sign-in asks only for `read:user` (no access to anyone's private repos). That's enough
  because the preset repos are public.

---

## Step 0: Fork and pick your names

1. Fork the repo to your GitHub account. Your preset repo will be `<your-username>/DevPilot`.
2. Make sure the fork is **public**: demo mode indexes it with a `read:user` token, which can only read public repos.
3. Pick a Vercel project name now, e.g. `devpilot-<yourname>`. Your frontend URL will be
   `https://devpilot-<yourname>.vercel.app`. You need this URL *before* creating the GitHub OAuth
   app and the Render service, so write it down. (If Vercel adds a suffix because the name is
   taken, update the URLs in steps 3 and 4 to match.)

Below, `FRONTEND` means that URL (no trailing slash).

## Step 1: Database (Neon)

1. Sign up at neon.com (no card needed) and create a project. Pick region **AWS US East 2 (Ohio)**,
   because the Render service uses Ohio too. Keeping them close makes every query faster.
2. On the project dashboard click **Connect**. Turn **Connection pooling off** (use the direct
   connection) and copy the connection string. It looks like:
   `postgresql://neondb_owner:AbC123@ep-cool-name-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`
3. Split it into the three values Spring Boot wants:
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` = `jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-name-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`
     (add `jdbc:`, drop the `user:password@` part)
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME` = `neondb_owner`
   - `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` = `AbC123`

You don't need to create any tables or extensions. On first start, the app creates its tables (Hibernate)
and the `vector` table/extension (Spring AI).

## Step 2: OpenAI key (with a spending cap)

1. On platform.openai.com, add a small credit (minimum ~$5) under Billing.
2. Create a **project** for DevPilot and set a **monthly budget** on it (e.g. $5). This is your
   hard safety net on top of the app's own question caps.
3. Create an API key in that project → `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Rough cost: indexing a repo the size of DevPilot is about a cent of embeddings. Each question on
`gpt-4o-mini` costs a fraction of a cent.

## Step 3: GitHub OAuth app (for your owner sign-in)

GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → **OAuth Apps** → New OAuth App:

- Application name: `DevPilot`
- Homepage URL: `FRONTEND`
- Authorization callback URL: `FRONTEND/login/oauth2/code/github`

Create it, then **Generate a new client secret**. Keep both values: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and
`GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. Use a separate OAuth app from your local one, because each OAuth app has one callback URL.

## Step 4: Backend (Render)

1. Sign up at render.com with GitHub. **New → Blueprint**, pick your fork. Render reads
   `render.yaml` and proposes one service, `devpilot-api`, on the Free plan.
2. Fill in the values it asks for:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` / `_USERNAME` / `_PASSWORD` | from step 1 |
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | from step 2 |
   | `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | from step 3 |
   | `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` | `FRONTEND/login/oauth2/code/github` |
   | `FRONTEND_URL` | `FRONTEND` |
   | `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `FRONTEND` |
   | `TOKEN_ENCRYPTOR_SALT` | output of `openssl rand -hex 8` (16 hex chars) |
   | `DEMO_ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAMES` | your GitHub username |
   | `DEMO_REPOS` | `<your-username>/DevPilot` (comma-separate to add more) |

   `TOKEN_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD` is generated for you. Don't change it later, or stored GitHub
   tokens can't be decrypted (you'd just need to sign in again).
3. Apply. The first build compiles the backend in Docker and takes several minutes.
4. When it's live, copy the service URL (e.g. `https://devpilot-api-ab12.onrender.com`) and open
   `<that URL>/actuator/health`. You should see `{"status":"UP"}`.

If the deploy fails, open the service's **Logs**. Most failures are a typo in the database
values. See Troubleshooting below.

## Step 5: Frontend (Vercel)

1. Sign up at vercel.com with GitHub. **Add New → Project**, import your fork.
2. Project name: the one from step 0. **Root Directory: `client`** (important). Framework: Next.js (auto-detected).
3. Environment variable: `BACKEND_URL` = your Render URL from step 4 (no trailing slash).
   Do **not** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` on Vercel; `BACKEND_URL` takes care of it.
4. Deploy. Check that the production URL matches `FRONTEND`. If not, update the GitHub OAuth app
   and the three Render variables that contain it.

## Step 6: Index the preset repo (one time)

1. Open `FRONTEND/login` and click **Owner sign-in with GitHub** (wait a minute if the backend is waking up).
2. On the dashboard click **Sync**, find `<your-username>/DevPilot`, click **Index**.
3. Wait for **Ready**, then ask a test question in chat.

## Step 7: Test it as a visitor

Open `FRONTEND` in a private/incognito window → **Try the live demo**. You should see only the
preset repo, no Sync/Index buttons, and chat should work. That's the link for your portfolio.

---

## Putting it on your portfolio

- Link straight to `FRONTEND/login` so visitors land on the **Try the live demo** button.
- Mention the cold start next to the link ("free hosting, first load takes ~1 min"). That way a
  recruiter waits instead of assuming the site is down.
- A 30–60 second screen recording or a few screenshots next to the link helps people who won't wait.
- Credit the team (the contributors listed in `README.md`) and say what *you* built.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Login page shows "Waking up the server…" for over 2 minutes | Render is still deploying or crashed. Check Render logs |
| GitHub says "redirect_uri is not associated with this application" | OAuth app callback ≠ `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI`. They must match exactly |
| After GitHub sign-in you land back on `/login?error=...` | `FRONTEND_URL` or `GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI` points at the wrong domain |
| Owner sign-in works but there's no Sync/Index | Your username isn't in `DEMO_ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAMES` (it's case-insensitive) |
| "Demo mode only indexes the preset repos" | Add the repo's `owner/name` to `DEMO_REPOS` and redeploy |
| Visitors see no repos | The preset repo isn't indexed yet, or `DEMO_REPOS` doesn't match its full name |
| Indexing fails with 404 from GitHub | The repo is private. Make it public, or set `GITHUB_OAUTH_SCOPES=read:user,repo` |
| Render log: `Connection to ... refused` / `password authentication failed` | Recheck the three Neon values; the URL must start with `jdbc:postgresql://` |
| Render log: `OutOfMemoryError` | The free instance has 512 MB. Lower heap with `JAVA_OPTS=-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60 -XX:+UseSerialGC -Xss512k -XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1` |
| Indexing stops with "interrupted by a server restart" | Render slept or restarted mid-index. Click Retry, and keep the tab open while it runs |

## Optional: skip the cold start

A free Render service has enough monthly hours (750) to stay awake all month if something pings it
every ~10 minutes, e.g. a scheduled GitHub Action that does `curl <render-url>/actuator/health`. The
health check doesn't touch the database, so Neon still sleeps. Read Render's current free-tier
terms before doing this, and note that Render's paid Starter instance ($7/mo) removes sleep entirely.

## Running demo mode locally

Add to your `.env`:

```
DEMO_MODE=true
DEMO_ADMIN_GITHUB_USERNAMES=<your-username>
DEMO_REPOS=<your-username>/DevPilot
```

then `docker compose up --build` as usual.
