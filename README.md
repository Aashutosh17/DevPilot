# DevPilot

**Understand your codebase with AI.**

DevPilot is an AI-powered GitHub repository assistant that helps developers explore, understand, and navigate their codebases using natural language.

Instead of manually searching through multiple files to understand how a feature works, developers can connect their GitHub repositories and ask questions about their code.

The project is built using Spring Boot, Next.js, Spring AI, and PostgreSQL with pgvector.

## Features

- **GitHub Authentication:** Sign in securely using GitHub OAuth 2.0.
- **Repository Integration:** Connect and manage GitHub repositories.
- **AI-Powered Code Search:** Use natural language to find and understand relevant code.
- **Repository Indexing:** Process source files into searchable chunks and vector embeddings.
- **Context-Aware Answers:** Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate answers based on repository content.
- **Indexing Status:** Track repository indexing progress and status.

> **Development status:** DevPilot is under active development. GitHub authentication and repository management form the foundation of the application, while the RAG indexing and AI question-answering workflows are being developed.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js, React, TypeScript |
| Backend | Java 21, Spring Boot |
| Authentication | Spring Security, GitHub OAuth 2.0 |
| AI Integration | Spring AI, OpenAI |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Vector Database | pgvector |
| ORM | Spring Data JPA, Hibernate |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Docker Compose |
| Build Tool | Gradle |

## How It Works

DevPilot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide answers based on the actual contents of a repository.

1. **Connect:** The user signs in with GitHub and selects a repository.
2. **Index:** Repository files are fetched, filtered, and divided into smaller code chunks.
3. **Embed:** Spring AI converts code chunks into vector embeddings.
4. **Store:** Embeddings and related metadata are stored in PostgreSQL using pgvector.
5. **Retrieve:** Relevant code chunks are retrieved when the user asks a question.
6. **Generate:** The AI model uses the retrieved context to produce an answer.

This approach helps ground AI-generated responses in the repository's source code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- Git
- Docker Desktop
- Node.js and npm
- Java 21 (for running the backend outside Docker)

You will also need GitHub OAuth credentials and an OpenAI API key for the corresponding integrations.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aashutosh17/DevPilot.git
cd DevPilot
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create the required environment configuration using the project's application settings.

Configure the PostgreSQL connection, GitHub OAuth client credentials, OpenAI API key, and any application security secrets required by the backend.

Keep credentials in local environment files or environment variables. Do not commit secrets to GitHub.

### 3. Start Docker Services

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This builds and starts the services defined in the Docker Compose configuration.

To run the containers in the background:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 4. Start the Frontend

Open another terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit:

**http://localhost:3000**

If port 3000 is already occupied, Next.js may select another available port.

### 5. Stop the Application

To stop the Docker services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

The backend handles authentication, repository operations, indexing, and AI integration. The frontend provides the user interface for interacting with repositories and AI-powered features.

## About

DevPilot is being developed as a Computer Science capstone project at Clark University.

The project explores how AI-assisted software engineering tools can make large codebases easier to understand and navigate.
